    "# Run benchmark with different variables to find combination which could lead to optimal ingestion performance\n",
    "When ingesting data to OpenSearch using bulk API, using different variables could result in different ingestion performance. For example, the amount of document in bulk API, how many OpenSearch clients are used to send requests etc. It's not easy for user to experiment with all the combinations of the variables and find the option which could lead to optimal ingestion performance. In OpenSearch-2.15.0, a new parameter \"batch size\" was introduced in bulk API which could significantly reduce ingestion time when using with `text_embedding` processor and `sparse_encoding` processor. However, this additional impactor could make the variable tuning even more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is to help dealing with the pain point of tuning these variables which could impact ingestion performance and automatically find the optimal combination of the variables. It utilizes the OpenSearch-Benchmark, uses different varible combination to run benchmark, collects their outputs, analyzes and visualizes the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three variables that you can test against: bulk size, OS client number, batch size. If you already have a perferred value for certain variable, you can simply set it to a fixed value and only test other variables. For example, you always use 1 client to run bulk API with bulk size equals to 100, then you can only try different batch size to see which batch size can have the best performance."

    "Use `BULK_SIZE` to set a fixed bulk size value, e.g. `BULK_SIZE=100`\n",

    "3. CLIENT_OPTIONS same as \"--client-options\" in OSB `execute-test`, \"Define a comma-separated list of client options to use. The options will be passed to the OpenSearch Python client (default: timeout:60).\""
